### Hi, I'm Brett ðŸ‘‹

After 5 years of working as a Mechanical Engineer, I've pivoted to Web Development (which is apparently a common thing in the industry) and I'm currently completing a doiploma at Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp.

I started adding to my coding knowledge base from my mech eng degree program, mainly C and MATLAB, and into JS and HTML, which led me to taking the LHL Bootcamp.
