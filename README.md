### Hi, I'm Brett ðŸ‘‹

After 5 years of working as a Mechanical Engineer, I've pivoted to Web Development (which is apparently a common thing in the industry) and I'm currently completing a diploma at Lighthouse Labs Bootcamp.

I started adding to my coding knowledge base from my mech eng degree program, mainly C and MATLAB, and into JS and HTML, which led me to taking the LHL Bootcamp. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an instrument rental app called [JamSpace](https://github.com/bbjarvis/JamSpace), like Turo for musicians
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently 100 Days of Code to learn Python.
- :round_pushpin: I live in Kelowna, BC
